# Repte Pessebre - Artesa de Segre

This is a **gamified local commerce promotion application** for the town of Artesa de Segre (Catalonia). The project creates an interactive Christmas experience that combines tourism, storytelling, and local business support.

## Project Concept

**"Repte Pessebre" (Nativity Challenge)** is a mobile-friendly web application that:

### How it Works

1. **Store Participation**: Local businesses display small nativity scenes (pessebre) in their shop windows
2. **QR Code Scanning**: Each display has a QR code that visitors can scan with their phones
3. **Story Unlocking**: As users collect QR codes, they progressively unlock chapters of a story called "El Pessebre d'Artesa de Segre" (The Nativity of Artesa de Segre)
4. **Final Challenge**: The last QR code is special - it's only available to customers who make a purchase at participating businesses
5. **Complete Experience**: To finish the entire story, users must both explore the town AND support local commerce

### Objectives

- **Tourism**: Encourage people to walk around and explore Artesa de Segre
- **Local Commerce**: Drive foot traffic and sales to participating businesses
- **Cultural Engagement**: Share local stories and Christmas traditions
- **Community Building**: Create a fun, interactive experience for residents and visitors

### Technical Implementation

The Angular application you're working on likely includes:

- QR code scanning functionality
- Story/chapter management system
- Progress tracking for users
- Interactive storytelling interface
